Summary:

This postmortem details the investigation and recovery process for a server outage that occurred on 12 february 2023 at 12:00pm. The server  became unresponsive and inaccessible to users.  The cause of the outage was identified as a faulty hard drive.

Timeline:

	[12:00]: Users begin reporting issues accessing [Server Name].
	[12:13]: IT staff is alerted to the server outage.
	[12:37]: Initial investigation confirms server is unresponsive.
	[13:09]: Remote diagnostics identify a failed hard drive.
	[13:20]: System is taken offline for maintenance.
	[14:01]: The faulty drive was replaced.
	[14:34]: System undergoes data recovery procedures
	[14:54]: System boots successfully and undergoes testing.
	[15:17]: Server is brought back online.

Root Cause:

The server outage was caused by a single, faulty hard drive.

Impact:

The server outage resulted in users being unable to access the website, users reported timeouts on web pages and disconnected messages. The duration of the outage was 4 hours and 17 minutes in total.

Resolution:

The IT team replaced the faulty drive and brought the server back online. Whatever data could be recovered from redudant (backup) drives was restored.

Lessons Learned:

This incident highlights the importance of having a robust backup and recovery plan in place.
Regularly scheduled health checks and S.M.A.R.T. monitoring of hard drives can help identify potential failures before they cause outages. Redundant storage configurations like RAID can help mitigate data loss in the event of a drive failure.

Action Items:

	Review backup procedures and ensure all critical data is backed up regularly.
	Implement a system for monitoring S.M.A.R.T. status of hard drives and schedule replacements for failing drives.
	Investigate improving our redundant storage solution to make it harder to fail.

Next Steps:

The IT team will continue to monitor the server performance and make any necessary adjustments to prevent similar outages in the future.
